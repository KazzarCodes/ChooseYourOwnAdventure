Database design : 

I was contemplating the current table design against using a single class/recursive pattern:

class NodeBase {
    ...
    List<NodeBase> childNodes;
}

which would have better allowed for answers other than yes/no. I chose the current design for simplicity reasons as the spec asked. 
I also wanted to put more focus on the back-end side relating to this role.
